                    <h1>Linn Fritz</h1>
                    <p>Swedish illustrator, designer and animator Linn Fritz lives and works in London where she creates charmingly clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for a wide range of editorial and commercial clients. Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her time at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as “hands down one of the best experiences” of her life. “My Hyper Island journey completely changed me as a person.” she says, “It pushed me to work harder and gave me the tools to succeed in the real world.”</p>
                    <p>The progressive nature of Hyper Island led Linn to abandon pen and paper and concentrate on what digital could offer her already well-honed drawings. As she puts it, “There’s more freedom drawing digitally, and more room for mistakes.” Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, “a community of equality-driven women, trans and non-binary friends aiming to connect and support each other within the animation industry.”</p>
                    <p>Some of her favorite projects often orbit around her interests of “feminism, clothes, plants and interior” but Linn also looks for a good client relationship, one with trust and creative freedom.</p>
